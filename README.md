# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer responses to telephonic marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. By identifying potential customers who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit, the bank can optimize resources and improve the efficiency of its campaigns.

## **Dataset**
The data pertains to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank and contains two datasets:

### **Features Description**
The dataset is divided into the following categories:

#### **Bank Client Data**
1. **age**: Age of the client (numeric)
2. **job**: Type of job
3. **marital**: Marital status
4. **education**: Level of education
5. **default**: Has credit in default? 
6. **balance**: Average yearly balance in euros
7. **housing**: Has a housing loan? 
8. **loan**: Has a personal loan?

#### **Campaign-related Attributes**
9. **contact**: Communication type
10. **day**: Last contact day of the month
11. **month**: Last contact month of the year
12. **duration**: Last contact duration in seconds

#### **Other Attributes**
13. **campaign**: Number of contacts performed during this campaign
14. **pdays**: Days since the client was last contacted in a previous campaign
15. **previous**: Number of contacts performed before this campaign
16. **poutcome**: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign

## **Objectives**
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and relationships between variables.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Build machine learning models to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
4. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and optimize for better accuracy.

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Plotly
- **Visualization Tools**: Excel, Power BI
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / IDE of choice

## **Project Workflow**
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Development
4. Model Optimization
5. Prediction

## **Evaluation Metrics**
The following metrics will be used to evaluate model performance:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- F1-Score
